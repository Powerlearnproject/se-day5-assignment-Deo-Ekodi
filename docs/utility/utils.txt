Component: SimulationUtils
Responsibilities:
Provides general-purpose utility functions that support the core simulation components.
Includes mathematical tools, data validation routines, and performance optimization methods.
Key Functions:
interpolateData(): Performs interpolation for data points where values are missing or need to be estimated.
validateParameters(): Checks that simulation parameters are within acceptable ranges.
optimizePerformance(): Implements strategies for optimizing the performance of the simulation, especially for large datasets.
Component: Pipe
Responsibilities:
Represents a single pipe within the wastewater network.
Encapsulates all relevant parameters, such as length, diameter, roughness, and flow capacity.
Key Functions:
calculateHeadLoss(): Computes the head loss due to friction and other factors within the pipe.
updateFlowConditions(): Adjusts the flow conditions based on solver outputs.
storeParameters(): Holds all the relevant parameters and properties of the pipe.
Component: Results
Responsibilities:
Stores the output of the simulation, including all relevant data such as flow rates, velocities, pollutant concentrations, and more.
Key Functions:
saveIntermediateResults(): Stores results at each time step for later analysis.
retrieveFinalResults(): Provides access to the final results of the simulation for reporting and visualization.
