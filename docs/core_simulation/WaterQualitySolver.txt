Component: QualitySolver
Responsibilities:
Analyzes the quality of wastewater, including pollutant concentrations, chemical reactions, and contaminant transport.
Simulates the interaction between different pollutants and their impact on overall water quality.
Key Functions:
computeConcentration(): Calculates the concentration of pollutants in different parts of the system.
modelReactions(): Models chemical reactions that occur within the wastewater (e.g., oxidation, nitrification).
transportContaminants(): Simulates the movement and dispersion of contaminants throughout the network.
updateQualityState(): Updates the water quality state within the WastewaterModel.
