Component: BoundaryConditions
Responsibilities:
Defines and manages the conditions at the boundaries of the system, such as inflows, outflows, and external pressures.
Ensures that the simulation accurately reflects the real-world scenario by applying these conditions consistently.
Key Functions:
setInflowCondition(): Defines the inflow conditions at the entry points of the wastewater system.
setOutflowCondition(): Defines the outflow conditions at the exit points of the wastewater system.
applyExternalForces(): Considers external forces such as atmospheric pressure or external pumping that affect the system.
