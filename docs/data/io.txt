Component: InputHandler
Responsibilities:
Manages the reading and parsing of input data required to initialize the simulation.
Handles input files that define the system's configuration, including pipe properties, initial conditions, and boundary conditions.
Key Functions:
readConfigFile(): Reads and parses the configuration file to extract simulation parameters.
loadInitialConditions(): Loads initial conditions for the simulation, such as starting flow rates and pollutant levels.
validateInputData(): Ensures that input data is valid and within expected ranges.


Component: OutputHandler
Responsibilities:
Manages the output of simulation results, including saving data to files and generating reports.
Ensures that the results are stored in a format that is accessible and understandable by the user.
Key Functions:
writeResultsToFile(): Saves simulation results to a file in a specified format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
generateReport(): Produces a summary report of the simulation, highlighting key findings and results.
exportVisualizationData(): Prepares data for visualization, allowing users to create graphs or maps of the results.
